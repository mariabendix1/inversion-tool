(VAR l ls r1 a tl hd r)
(RULES
  rev(r) -> <ls> <= r1([], r) -> <ls>

  r1(a, []) -> <a>
  r1(ls, :(l, a)) -> <r> <= r1(:(l, ls), a) -> <r>
)
(COMMENT
  This inversion was done by hand using nishida/vidal
  [m,a,r,i,a] -> r1([], [m,a,r,i,a])
              -> r1([m], [a,r,i,a])
              -> r1([a,m], [r,i,a])
              -> ....
